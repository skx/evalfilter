# eval-filter

The evalfilter package provides an embeddable evaluation-engine, which allows simple logic which might otherwise be hardwired into your golang application to be delegated to (user-written) script(s).

There is no shortage of embeddable languages which are available to the golang world, this library is intended to be a simple one, allowing simple tests to be made against structures/objects.


## Overview

The `evalfilter` library provides the means to embed a small scripting engine in your golang application (which is known as the host application).

The scripting language is C-like, and allows you to _filter_ objects, with the general expectation that a script will return `true` or `false` allowing you to decide what to do after running it.

In terms of implementation the script is first split into [tokens](token/token.go) by the [lexer](lexer/lexer.go), then that is [parsed](parser/parser.go) into an abstract-syntax-tree.  Once the AST exists it is walked, and a series of [bytecode](code/code.go) operations are generated.  All of this happens in the `Prepare` method.

Once you're ready to execute the script against a particular object the bytecode is intepreted by a simple [virtual machine](vm/vm.go) in the `Run` method.  As this is a stack-based virtual machine, rather than a register-based one, we have a [stack](stack/stack.go) implementation which is used by the intepreter.


### Bytecode

The bytecode is used internally only, but it is documented in [BYTECODE.md](BYTECODE.md).


## Use Cases

The backstory behind this project is explained in [this blog-post](https://blog.steve.fi/a_slack_hack.html), but in brief I wanted to read incoming Slack messages and react to specific ones to carry out an action.

The expectation was that non-developers might want to change the matching of messages, without having to know how to rebuild my application, or understand Go.  So the logic was moved into a script and this evaluation engine was born.

This is a pretty good use for an evaluation engine and operation was pretty simple:

* Create an instance of the `evalfilter`.
* Load the user's script, which will let messages be matched.
* For each incoming message run the script against it.
  * If it returns `true` you know you should carry out your interesting activity.
  * Otherwise you will not.

To make this more concrete we'll pretend we have the following structure to describe incoming messages:

    type Message struct {
        Author  string
        Channel string
        Message string
        Sent    time.Time
    }

The user could now write the following script to test if an incoming message was worth reacting to:

    //
    // You can see that comments are prefixed with "//".
    //
    // This script is invoked by your Golang application as a filter,
    // the intent is that the user's script will terminate with either:
    //   return false;
    // or
    //   return true;
    //
    // Your host application will then carry out the interesting operation
    // when it receives a `true` result.
    //

    //
    // If we have a message from Steve it is interesting!
    //
    if ( Author == "Steve" ) { return true; }

    //
    // A bug is being discussed?  Awesome.
    //
    if ( Message ~=  "panic" ) { return true; }

    //
    // OK the message is uninteresting, and will be discarded, or
    // otherwise ignored.
    //
    return false;

You'll notice that we don't define the _object_ here, because it is implied that the script operates upon a single instance of the `Message` structure.   That means `Author` is implicitly the author-field of the message object, which the `Run` method was invoked with.



## Sample Usage

To give you a quick feel for how things look you could consult:

* [example_test.go](example_test.go).
  * This filters a list of people by their age.
* [example_function_test.go](example_function_test.go).
  * This exports a function from the golang-host application to the script.
  * The new function is then used to filter a list of people.

Other examples are available beneath the [_examples/](_examples/) directory, and there is a general-purpose utility located in [cmd/evalfilter](cmd/evalfilter) which allows you to examine bytecode, tokens, and run scripts.



## API Stability

The API will remain as-is for given major release number, so far we've had we've had two major releases:

* 1.x.x
  * The initial implementation which parsed script into an AST then walked it.
* 2.x.x
  * The updated design which parses the given script into an AST, then generates bytecode to execute when the script is actually run.

The second release was implemented to perform a significant speedup for the case where the same script might be reused multiple times.


## Scripting Facilities

The engine supports scripts which:

* Perform comparisons of strings and numbers:
  * equality:
    * "`if ( Message == "test" ) { return true; }`"
  * inequality:
    * "`if ( Count != 3 ) { return true; }`"
  * size (`<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`):
    * "`if ( Count >= 10 ) { return false; }`"
    * "`if ( Hour >= 8 && Hour <= 17 ) { return false; }`"
  * String contains:
    * "`if ( Content ~= "needle" )`"
  * Does not contain:
    * "`if ( Content !~ "some text we dont want" )`"
* You can also add new primitives to the engine.
  * By implementing them in your golang host application.
  * Your host-application can also set variables which are accessible to the user-script.
* Finally there is a `print` primitive to allow you to see what is happening, if you need to.
  * This is just one of the built-in functions, but perhaps the most useful.

You'll note that you're referring to structure-fields by name, they are found dynamically via reflection.  The  `if` conditions can be nested, and also support an `else` clause.



### Built-In Functions

As we noted earlier you can export functions from your host-application and make them available to the scripting environment, as demonstrated in the [example_function_test.go](example_function_test.go) sample, but of course there are some built-in functions which are always available:

* `len(field | value)`
  * Returns the length of the given value, or the contents of the given field.
* `lower(field | value)`
  * Return the lower-case version of the given input.
* `match(field | str, regexp)`
  * Returns `true` if the specified string matches the supplied regular expression.
  * You can make this case-insensitive using `(?i)`, for example:
    * `if ( match( "Steve" , "(?i)^steve$" ) ) { ... `
* `trim(field | string)`
  * Returns the given string, or the contents of the given field, with leading/trailing whitespace removed.
* `type(field | value)`
  * Returns the type of the given field, as a string.
    * For example `string`, `integer`, `float`, `boolean`, or `null`.
* `upper(field | value)`
  * Return the upper-case version of the given input.


## Variables

Your host application can also register variables which are accessible to your scripting environment via the `SetVariable` method.  The variables can have their values updated at any time before the call to `Eval` is made.

For example the following example sets the contents of the variable `time`, and then outputs it.  Every second the output will change, because the value has been updated:

    eval := evalfilter.New(`
                print("The time is ", time, "\n");
                return false;
            `)

    eval.Prepare()

    for {

        // Set the variable `time` to be the seconds past the epoch.
        eval.SetVariable("time", &object.Integer{Value: time.Now().Unix()})

        // Run the script.
        eval.Run(nil)

        // Update every second.
        time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
    }

This example is available, with error-checking, in [_examples/variable/](_examples/variable/).


## Standalone Use

If you wish to experiment with script-syntax you can install the standalone driver:

```
go get github.com/skx/evalfilter/cmd/evalfilter

```

The driver has a number of sub-commands to allow you to test a script, for example viewing the parse-tree, the byecode, or even running a script against a JSON object.

For example in the [cmd/evalfilter](cmd/evalfilter) directory you might run:

     ./evalfilter run -json on-call.json on-call.script

This will test a script against a JSON object, allowing you to experiment with changing either.  This driver an also be used to reproduce any problems identified via [fuzz-testing](FUZZING.md).


## Benchmarking

If you wish to run a local benchmark you should be able to do so as follows:

```
$ go test -test.bench=evalfilter -benchtime=10s -run=^t
goos: linux
goarch: amd64
pkg: github.com/skx/evalfilter
Benchmark_evalfilter_complex-4   	 5000000	      3895 ns/op
Benchmark_evalfilter_simple-4    	500000000	        25.6 ns/op
PASS
ok  	github.com/skx/evalfilter	38.934s
```

Neither example there is completely representative, but it will give you
an idea of the speed.  In the majority of cases the speed of the evaluation
engine will be acceptible.


## Github Setup

This repository is configured to run tests upon every commit, and when pull-requests are created/updated.  The testing is carried out via [.github/run-tests.sh](.github/run-tests.sh) which is used by the [github-action-tester](https://github.com/skx/github-action-tester) action.
